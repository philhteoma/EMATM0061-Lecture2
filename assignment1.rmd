```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Quick initial dataframe 
```{r animals}
animals <- c("Snake", "Ostrich", "Cat", "Spider")
legs <- c(0, 2, 4, 8)
animalLegsDf <- data.frame(animals, legs)

animalLegsDf

```
## 2. Matrix Operations

Generate some matrices with seq()
``` {r}
print("Hello")

x_vect <- seq(12, 2, -2)
x_vect

x_matrix = matrix(x_vect, 2, 3)
x_matrix

y_matrix <-matrix(seq(4), 2, 2)
y_matrix

z_matrix <- matrix(seq(4, 10, 2), 2, 2)
z_matrix

```

Fun with transposing
``` {r transposing}
y_matrix
t(y_matrix)

z_matrix
t(z_matrix)
```

Matrice Addition
``` {r}
y_matrix + z_matrix
z_matrix + y_matrix
```
### Matrice Multiplication

Simple matrix product
```{r}
y_matrix
z_matrix
```
Using * operator, we just get each element multipled by its match in the other matrix
```{r}
y_matrix * z_matrix
```

We use %*% for the matrix product
```{r}
y_matrix %*% z_matrix
```

This isn't commutative! Reversing the order changes the outcome
``` {r}
z_matrix %*% y_matrix
```

For the simpler element-wise product (Hadarmard), we use only *")
``` {r}
y_matrix * z_matrix
```

This is commutative
``` {r}
z_matrix * y_matrix

```


Computing YX, two matrices with different sizes
Matrix product:
```{r}
y_matrix %*% x_matrix

```
Attempting XY results in an error

"Solving" matrices
```{r}
solve(y_matrix)

solve(y_matrix) %*% y_matrix

solve(y_matrix) %*% x_matrix
```
We should be able to use solve() for Y^-1^X

```{r}
solve(y_matrix, x_matrix)
```

## Simple R Functions

Create a simple r function which takes all numbers between 0 and n which are divisble by 2 and/or 7
```{r}
the_func <- function(n) {
 sum <- 0
 for (i in seq(n-1)) {
   if (i%%2==0 | i%%7==0) { #Modulo is double % in r, | for the or operator
     sum <- sum+i
   }
 }
 return(sum)
}

print(the_func(1000))
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
